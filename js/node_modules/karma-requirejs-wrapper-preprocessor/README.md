# karma-requirejs-wrapper-preprocessor
A Karma preprocessor module that can be used to wrap the contents of files with a 'require() {}' call. While it can technically be used in a standalone manner with any data files, this module has been primarily developed to wrap the result of the ng-html2js processor module, for projects that primarily use requirejs in conjuction with angularjs.
